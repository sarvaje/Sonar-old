            | url2 | url1  |
            | url3 | url2  |

            `targetUrl` is initially `url4` (the url for what we got the response for). We make our way
            up until `url1`. When we check if `url1` has any redirect, we don't find anything so we
            know we've reached the original `resourceUrl` and we can stop looking.
            Because `hops` always contains the latest url, we `pop` to have the intermediate requests.
